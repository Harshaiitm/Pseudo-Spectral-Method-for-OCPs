# Pseudo-Spectral-Method-for-OCPs
LegendrePS.m the main file which helps to find the differentiation matrix of LGL,LGR,LG by using the function file called collocD.m which takes the nodes as input and gives the Differential matrix corresponding to the PS method
DImain.m main script in Double Integrator Tracking problem can execute all three PS_methods (LGL,LG,LGR) based on the user defined PS_method.
